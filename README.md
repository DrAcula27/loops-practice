<h2>Per Scholas - Week1 - JS and CSS Concepts - Assignment: Loops Practice</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create Git / Github Repo.</li>
  <li>Write a for loop that logs 0-15.</li>
  <li>Write a for loop that counts from 15-0.</li>
  <li>Make variable laps = 0. Write a for loop that logs (“that’s another lap!”) and adds 1 to the laps variable. AFTER the loop, log laps.</li>
  <li>git add, commit, push.</li>
  <li>Make variable age. Make a loop from 0-100. In every loop check if i == age, if so log something, else say “age doesn’t match”.</li>
  <li>Write a loop that logs all even numbers from 0-700.</li>
  <li>Write a loop that logs all odd numbers from 0-700.</li>
  <li>Write a loop with some “if else” statements. The loop should start at 1900 and go to 1949 and log when things were invented. For example when i = 1902 the code should log “it is 1902 - the teddy bear is invented!”</li>
  <li>git add, commit, push.</li>
</ol>
<p>I added some HTML and CSS so I could make a GitHub page for this repo.</p>
